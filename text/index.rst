=======================================
Welcome to the School of Data Handbook
=======================================

The School of Data Handbook is a companion text to the `School of Data`_. Its
function is something like a traditional textbook - it will provide the detail
and background theory to support the School of Data courses and challenges.

The Handbook should be accessible to all learners. It comes
with a :doc:`appendix/glossary` explaining the important terms and concepts. If you
stumble across an unexplained term or a concept that requires more explanation,
please do get in touch.
