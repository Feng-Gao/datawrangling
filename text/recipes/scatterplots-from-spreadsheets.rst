Walkthrough: Scatterplot
========================

So let’s create a scatterplot.

#. Start with the sheet we created for the map above.
#. Copy it to a new sheet and put the columns “healthcare expenditure total per person” and “life expectancy” next to each other.

#. Click ``insert`` ``charts...`` and select “scatter plot” from charts.
#. Select the first one, since this is what we want to do.
#. And there you go: simply adapt the scatterplot so it looks nice. Don’t forget to label axes. Try to make the dots smaller if there is significant overlap.
