Creating a Choropleth map
===========================

#. Filter for a single year (e.q. 2009) insert a new sheet and copy the filtered data into it.
#. As with all previous charts also here the columns need to be in a special position.
#. Move your data column (the one you want to use to display) right next to the country names.

#. Now mark the two columns and select “Chart...” from “insert”.
#. Under “Charts” select “Map” and then “geo chart - regions”.
#. You’ll see a preview. Play with the settings in customize to change the map, the colour-scale etc.
#. A note on colours: the red-green scale that is selected by default is not the best scale. So select a different one showing contrasts nicely.
