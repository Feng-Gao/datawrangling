============
Introduction
============

Data is everywhere and more and more is created every day - naturally more
and more decisions, stories and campains will be based on data. So where do
we start? The School of Data wants to provide this start: Welcome to our
handbook that will help you learn or teach basic data skills. That's right:
this book is both for people who want to teach or learn about basic data
skills.

The Handbook is split into two major parts of content: 
:doc:`the-data-pipeline/index` and :doc:`recipes/index`. The data pipeline explains
all the steps to take from data to information - explaining what to look
out for and why certain steps are important. The recipes accompany the
steps and tell you how to practically do each step. 

The `:doc:glossary` explains used terms - whenever jargon is used we aspire
to explain it there. 

How to use this Book
--------------------

**As a Student** we want you to understand and grasp as much knowledge as
you can. We do think you will learn better by doing it: So read the first
three steps of :doc:`the-data-pipeline/index` and think about a question
you would like to answer using data. With each of the next steps: go
through the step and then pick one of the recipes and try to apply this to
your problem - at the end you ideally answered the question and are in a
state to tell others about it.

**As a Coach** the handbook gives you a good skeleton to base workshops on.
We'd advise you to go and read :doc:`how-to-run-an-event` for basic
organization. :doc:`the-data-pipeline/index` will give you an idea how to
structure a workshop or a series of workshops. Use it as an introduction to
the skills you are going to teach. The :doc:`recipes/index` will guide you
through how to do it practically. Best find sample datasets, relevant to
your audience, to teach with. We'd also encourage you to have the
participants choose their own problems (in small groups) and try what they
just learned.
