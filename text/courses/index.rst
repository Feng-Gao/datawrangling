Courses
=======

Welcome to the School of Data courses. School of Data produces two types of material:

* **Courses:** explain *why* something is important and help you to understand the basic decisions involved in picking particular tools or approaches and where it is worth investing your time.
* **Recipes:** explain *how* to do something and may advocate using a particular tool or method to do so.

Data might sound scary sometimes - donâ€™t worry, we're there to guide you through! If you have any questions about the material, simply drop us a line via the `mailing list`_
